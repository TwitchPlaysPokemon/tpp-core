/// The recommended usage is to start many lifecycle features, collect all their tasks,
/// and then await all of them concurrently using <see cref="TaskUtils.WhenAllFastExit(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{System.Threading.Tasks.Task})"/>,
/// so that any one task failing becomes visible immediately (in contrast to not awaiting the task until shutdown,
/// even though it could already be in an failure state that only bubbles up when awaiting).
